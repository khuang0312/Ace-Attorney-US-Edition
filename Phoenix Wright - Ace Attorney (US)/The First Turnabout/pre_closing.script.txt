"The evidence and testimony {n}presented in this trial {n}proves the defendant's guilt."

"He has admitted to being at the {n}apartment during the time of {n}the murder.

"As we heard from Mr. Sahwit, the {n}defendant fled from the apartment {n}right after committing the crime."

"The defense has questioned the {n}reliability of Mr. Sahwit's testimony, {n}but cannot prove one crucial thing:"

"The clock may be three hours slow {n}now..."
"but it does not mean the clock {n}was three hours slow on {n}the day of the murder."
"It is simply a coincidence that the clock is slow.

"The blackout that day cannot have {n}affected it since it runs on {n}batteries."

"As such, Mr. Sahwit's testimony {n}still stands."

"The defendant went to the victim's {n}apartment, got into an argument, {n}and took it too far.{n}"

"He had motive and the opportunity {n}to commit murder."

"The state asks that the defendant, {n}Larry Butz, be found guilty."
