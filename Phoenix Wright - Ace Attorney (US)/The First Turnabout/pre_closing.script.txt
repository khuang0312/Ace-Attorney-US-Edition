"The evidence and testimony {n}presented in this trial proves {n}the defendant's guilt."
"He has admitted to being at the {n}apartment during the time {n}of the murder.
"As we heard from Mr. Sahwit, the {n}defendant fled from the apartment {n}right after committing the crime."
"The defense has questioned the {n}reliability of Mr. Sahwit's testimony, {n}but cannot prove one crucial thing."
"Yes, the clock may be three hours {n}slow right now.
"But this does not necessarily mean {n}the clock was three hours slow on {n}the day of the murder."
"It is simply a coincidence that {n}the clock is currently slow.
"The blackout that day cannot have {n}affected it since it runs on {n}batteries."
"As such, Mr. Sahwit's testimony {n}still stands."
"The defendant went to the victim's {n}apartment, got into an argument, {n}and took it too far."
"He had motive and the opportunity {n}to commit murder."
"The state asks that the defendant, {n}Larry Butz, be found guilty."
