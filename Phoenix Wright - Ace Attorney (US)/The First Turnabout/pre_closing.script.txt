"Yes, the clock may be three hours {n}slow right now.

"It is simply a coincidence that {n}the clock is currently slow.
"The blackout that day cannot have {n}affected it since it runs on {n}batteries."
"As such, Mr. Sahwit's testimony {n}still stands."
"The defendant went to the victim's {n}apartment, got into an argument, {n}and took it too far."
