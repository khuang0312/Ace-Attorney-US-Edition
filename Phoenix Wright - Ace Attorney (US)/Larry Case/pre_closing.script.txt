"In order for Larry to be innocent, Sahwit must be..."


//In order for Larry to be innocent, Sahwit
list [timeHeard]
li [Lying about the time he heard.]
li [Telling the truth about the time he heard.]


//If Sahwit is telling the truth, then the clock
//-Was off the day of the murder.
//-Was not off the day of the murder.

The clock must have been off, due to
//-The blackout.
//-A natural cause.

//The cause must have been because the clock
//-Was brought to a different time zone
//-Was not designed to tell the time

//That’s right! The victim went to Paris. The difference between here and Paris is 9 hours, which means...
//-The clock is 3 hours slow
//-The clock is 9 hours fast

//WRONG CLOSING ANSWER:
//Phoenix: No, that can’t be right. I need to re-focus…
//Judge: The court does not appreciate stalling, Mr. Wright.
//[-10 penalty point]
