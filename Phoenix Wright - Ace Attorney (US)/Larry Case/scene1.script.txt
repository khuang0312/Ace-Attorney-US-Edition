"My name is Phoenix Wright, {n}attorney at law."
"Here's the story:"
"My first case is {n}a fairly simple one."
"A young woman was killed {n}in her apartment."
"The guy they arrested was {n}the unlucky sap dating her:"
"Larry Butz... my best {n}friend since grade school."
"Our school had a saying: {n}"When something smells, {n}it's usually the Butz."
"In the 23 years I've known {n}him, it's usually been true."
"He has a knack for getting {n}himself in trouble."
"One thing I can say, though: {n}it's usually not his fault. {n}He just has terrible luck."
"But I know better than anyone {n}that he's a good guy at heart."
"That and I owe him one. {n}Which is why I took the {n}case... to clear his name."
"And that's just what I'm {n}going to do!"
