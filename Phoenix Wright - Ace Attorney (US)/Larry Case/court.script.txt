"...but had broken up a few {n}weeks prior to July 31st."
"On that day, the defendant {n}entered the victim's apartment."
"There was a verbal altercation as reported by the neighbors,"
"after which he picked up a nearby {n}statue of the Thinker and {n}smashed her in the head."
"One blow killed her instantly."
"You will hear from a witness who saw {n}the defendant flee the scene right {n}after the moment of the crime."
"That same witness also discovered {n}the body afterwards."
"The defendant had a clear motive, {n}and the evidence clearly points {n}to his guilt."
"As such, the prosecution asks that {n}you find the defendant, Larry Butz, {n}guilty of murder."
