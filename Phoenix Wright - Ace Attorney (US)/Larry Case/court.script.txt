"On that day, the defendant entered the victim's apartment."
"There was a verbal altercation as reported by the neighbors."
"After which he picked up a nearby statue of the Thinker and smashed her in the head."
"One blow killed her instantly."
"A witness saw the defendant flee the scene right after the moment of the crime...

"The defendant had a clear motive, and the evidence clearly points to his guilt."

"While Mr. Butz had indeed broken up with Ms. Stone a few weeks prior to her murder..."

"In fact, he had gone to her apartment that day simply to see how she was doing."
"After realizing that she was out, he left the apartment without incident."

"The prosecution lacks definitive evidence proving that Mr. Butz murdered Ms. Stone that day."
