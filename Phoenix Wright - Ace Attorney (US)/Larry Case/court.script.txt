"The defendant, Larry Butz, and the victim, Cindy Stone, were dating..." 
"But had broken up a few weeks prior to July 31st."
"On that day, the defendant entered the victim's apartment."
"There was a verbal altercation as reported by the neighbors."
"After which he picked up a nearby statue of the Thinker and smashed her in the head."
"One blow killed her instantly."
"A witness saw the defendant flee the scene right after the moment of the crime...
"discovering the body afterwards."
"The defendant had a clear motive, and the evidence clearly points to his guilt."
"As such, the prosecution asks that you find the defendant, Larry Butz, guilty of murder."

"There is reasonable doubt as to whether or not the defendant, Larry Butz, committed murder on July 31st."
"While Mr. Butz had indeed broken up with Ms. Stone a few weeks prior to her murder..."
"he harbored no ill feelings toward Ms. Stone."
"In fact, he had gone to her apartment that day simply to see how she was doing."
"After realizing that she was out, he left the apartment without incident."

"The prosecution lacks definitive evidence proving that Mr. Butz murdered Ms. Stone that day."
"Mr. Butz was simply caught up in a series of events; he is no murderer."
"Because of that, we ask that you find the defendant, Larry Butz, not guilty."
