"This trial will determine whether {n}the defendant is guilty..."
"...or not guilty, based on the {n}testimony and evidence {n}provided in this case."

"...but had broken up a few {n}weeks prior to July 31st."
"On that day, the defendant {n}entered the victim's apartment."
"There was a verbal altercation as reported by the neighbors,"
"after which he picked up a nearby {n}statue of the Thinker and {n}smashed her in the head."
"One blow killed her instantly."
"You will hear from a witness who saw {n}the defendant flee the scene right {n}after the moment of the crime."

"There is reasonable doubt as to {n}whether or not the defendant,"

"he harbored no ill feelings {n}toward Ms. Stone."

"In fact, he had gone to her apartment {n}that day simply to see how she {n}was doing."
"After realizing that she was out, he {n}left the apartment without incident."

"The prosecution lacks definitive {n}evidence proving that Mr. Butz {n}murdered Ms. Stone that day."
"Mr. Butz was simply caught up in a {n}series of events; he is no murderer."

"Because of that, we ask that you {n}find the defendant, Larry Butz, {n}not guilty."
