"My name is Winston Payne, and I represent the state in this case."
"The defendant, Larry Butz, and the victim, Cindy Stone, were dating..." 
"But had broken up a few weeks prior to July 31st."
"On that day, the defendant entered the victim's apartment."
"There was a verbal altercation as reported by the neighbors."
"After which he picked up a nearby statue of the Thinker and smashed her in the head."
"One blow killed her instantly."
"A witness saw the defendant flee the scene right after the moment of the crime...
"discovering the body afterwards."
"The defendant had a clear motive, and the evidence clearly points to his guilt."
"As such, the prosecution asks that you find the defendant, Larry Butz, guilty of murder."
