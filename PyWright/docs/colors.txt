n the future, it might be a good idea to predefine colors instead of hardcoding the values. Also, don't forget that you can use html colors as well, which have 6 characters instead of 3 and give you a better range:

set color_red ff0000
set color_thoughts 338590

"{c red}This is bright red {c thoughts}This is the color for when someone is thinking"

That way, if you need to adjust the colors later, you only have to change it in one place.

Sorry for not communicating this option well.
