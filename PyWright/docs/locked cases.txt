Is statements should not have parenthesis for starters. They are not supported in expressions.

For case unlocking, it is easiest to use the macros. The game 10.91 has an example, and the macros themselves are stored in core/macros/cases.mcro.

Here is an example game/intro.txt:

[code]
locked_cases
{addcase caseone}
{addcase casetwo}
{addcase casethree}
casemenu
[/code]

Then, in the actual case, when the player is in a win situation, call "wincase".

You can also do "{resetcase casetwo}" if you need to relock it.
